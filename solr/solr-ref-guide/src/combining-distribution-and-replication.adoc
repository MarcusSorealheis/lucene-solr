When your index is too large for a single machine and you have a query volume that single shards cannot keep up with, it's time to replicate each shard in your distributed search setup.

The idea is to combine distributed search with replication. As shown in the figure below, a combined distributed-replication configuration features a primary server for each shard and then 1-_n_ secondaries that are replicated from the primary server. As in a standard replicated configuration, the primary server handles updates and optimizations without adversely affecting query handling performance.

Query requests should be load balanced across each of the shard secondaries. This gives you both increased query handling capacity and fail-over backup if a server goes down.

None of the primary shards in this configuration know about each other. You index to each primary server, the index is replicated to each secondary server, and then searches are distributed across the secondary shards, using one secondary shard from each primary/secondary shard.

For high availability you can use a load balancer to set up a virtual IP for each shard's set of secondaries. If you are new to load balancing, HAProxy (http://haproxy.1wt.eu/) is a good open source software load-balancer. If a secondary server goes down, a good load-balancer will detect the failure using some technique (generally a heartbeat system), and forward all requests to the remaining live secondaries that served with the failed secondary server. A single virtual IP should then be set up so that requests can hit a single IP, and get load balanced to each of the virtual IPs for the search secondaries.

With this configuration you will have a fully load balanced, search-side fault-tolerant system (Solr does not yet support fault-tolerant indexing). Incoming searches will be handed off to one of the functioning secondary servers, then the secondary server will distribute the search request across a secondary server for each of the shards in your configuration. The secondary server will issue a request to each of the virtual IPs for each shard, and the load balancer will choose one of the available secondaries. Finally, the results will be combined into a single results set and returned. If any of the secondaries go down, they will be taken out of rotation and the remaining secondaries will be used. If a shard primary goes down, searches can still be served from the secondaries until you have corrected the problem and put the primary back into production.
